Hi! I am Mohanna. I am currently a second-year PhD candidate in Conversational AI at Radboud University, where I am co-advised by Professors \href{https://www.ru.nl/personen/vries-a-de}{\textit{Arjen P. de Vries}}, \href{https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/}{\textit{Maarten de Rijke}}, and \href{https://hasibi.com/}{\textit{Faegheh Hasibi}}.

I am curious about many topics :) but at the moment, my research interests mainly encompass 1) Integrating knowledge bases with conversational systems for enhanced grounding 2) Employing neuro-symbolic solutions for reasoning with LLMs, and 3) Developing adaptive systems that automatically select the best answering strategies—be it direct response, retrieval, or reasoning—based on user input characteristics. With such a multifaceted research, we aim to enhance the robustness and adaptability of conversational agents.

You can find my full CV here.
