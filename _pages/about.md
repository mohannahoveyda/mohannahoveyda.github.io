Hi! I am Mohanna. 
Currently I am a second-year PhD candidate in Conversational AI at Radboud University, where I am co-advised by Professors [Arjen P. de Vries](https://www.ru.nl/personen/vries-a-de), [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/), and [Faegheh Hasibi](https://hasibi.com/).

I am curious about various topics :) At the moment, however, I am focused on the following research interests:
1. Integrating knowledge bases with conversational systems for enhanced grounding.
2. Employing neuro-symbolic solutions for reasoning with LLMs.
3. Developing adaptive systems that automatically select the best answering strategies—be it direct response, retrieval, or reasoning—based on user input characteristics.

With such a multifaceted research approach, we aim to enhance the robustness and adaptability of conversational systems.
