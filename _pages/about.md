Hi! I am Mohanna. <br>

Currently a second-year PhD candidate in *Conversational AI* at Radboud University, where I am co-advised by Professors [Arjen P. de Vries](https://www.ru.nl/personen/vries-a-de), [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/), and [Faegheh Hasibi](https://hasibi.com/).

Despite being curious about various topics in language and computation, at the moment, my research is centered on:
1. **Grounding** conversational systems using knowledge bases.
2. Employing neuro-symbolic solutions for **reasoning with LLMs**.
3. Developing **adaptive conversational systems** that automatically select the best answering strategies based on user input characteristics.

With this multifaceted approach, we aim to enhance the robustness and adaptability of conversational systems.

For more details about my background, please check out my full CV [here](http://mohannahoveyda.github.io/files/Mohanna_CV.pdf).
